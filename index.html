                     <p>If you are having an urgent need to prepare transfer pricing documentation, you have to be ready for a time-consuming process. The amount and complexity of work associated with it can easily turn this task into a real <b><span class="colortext">pain in the neck.</span></b></p>
                     <p>However, first you have to figure out whether you actually fall within the scope of the Article 39 or Paragraph 140.5.4 of the of the Tax Code of Ukraine and whether transfer pricing is something you have to deal with in the first place.</p>
                     </div>
                 <div class="headline">
                     <p class="line_red">You are expected to submit transfer pricing documentation, if your transactions are recognized as controlled.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="text">
                     <p>The very definition of controlled transactions has its hidden pitfalls, which is why it is hard to tackle this matter right away, especially against the backdrop of the ever-changing terms of the tax legislation.</p>
                     <p>In particular, in 2017-2018, changes were made both to the threshold amount of transactions involving counterparty and the requirements as to the taxpayer’s minimum net profit. Aside from that, some of the criteria for recognizing transactions as controlled were extended.</p>

                       <h2>Let's start off with the latter and try figure out when transactions are not deemed con- trolled.</h2>
                       <p>It stands to mention that the sharp eye of the State Fiscal Service has zero interest in "small" transactions: for the transaction to be deemed controlled, the sum of transactions involving one counterparty (by direct agreements or through intermediaries that perform no major functions within the framework of the agreement) shall start from UAH 10 million in 2017-2018 (or UAH 5 million in 2015-2016).</p>
                       <p>An additional criterion for recognizing transactions as controlled is the total amount of taxpayer's income resulting from all types of activities. In 2015-2016, the threshold amount was <b>UAH 50 million</b> and has been increased to UAH </p>

                       <h2>Companies having smaller revenues cannot have controlled transactions.</h2>
                       <p><b>The counterparty</b> is another crucial aspect when it comes to controlled transaction. Below is a list of criteria, according to which the transaction is recognized as controlled in 2018, obviously in case of the relevant sum of transactions and total amount of taxpayer’s income.</p>
